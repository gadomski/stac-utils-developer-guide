stac-utils developer guide
==========================

Welcome to the `stac-utils`_ developer guide! This book is designed for software
developers looking to contribute to repositories in the **stac-utils**
organization, which includes a wide variety of projects for working with `STAC`_
metadata and geospatial assets. For an introduction to the STAC specification
itself, we recommend reading the `STAC website <https://stacspec.org>`_.

This book includes:

- Recommended :doc:`tooling <tooling>` and :doc:`templates <templates/index>` for all repositories
- :doc:`Language specific guides <languages/index>` for repository setup, layout, and code styling
- Guidelines for :doc:`versioning projects <versioning>`
- A common :doc:`code of conduct <code-of-conduct>`
- :doc:`Policies <policies/index>` for adding new members and repositories to
  the **stac-utils** organization
