stac-utils developer guide
==========================

Welcome to the `stac-utils`_ developer guide!
This book is designed for software developers looking to contribute to repositories in the **stac-utils** organization, which includes a wide variety of projects for working with `STAC`_ metadata and geospatial assets.
For an introduction to the STAC specification itself, we recommend reading the `STAC website <https://stacspec.org>`_.

This book includes:

- A :doc:`style guide for Python code <python-style-guide>` that is shared among the **stac-utils** Python repositories
- :doc:`Documentation <best-practices/documentation>` and :doc:`Github actions <best-practices/github-actions>` best practices
- Guidelines for :doc:`versioning stac-utils projects <versioning>`
- Policies and procedures for :doc:`adding members <adding-a-member>` and :doc:`repositories <adding-a-repository>` to the **stac-utils** organization
- A common :doc:`code of conduct <code-of-conduct>`
