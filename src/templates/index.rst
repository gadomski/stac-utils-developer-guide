Templates
=========

Templates for Github issues, pull requests, etc. that should be used in all repositories.
Repositories are of course welcome to customize or add templates as they see fit.
The templates are provided as markdown files, and are written for PySTAC, so
will need a little customization if they're used in other repos.
